This project is a clone of my university website. Its basically a student/teacher portal, where users can create their accounts, login and and manage their accounts.

The project is created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, HTMX for frontend and Python, Django for the backend and the Django based ORM with SQLite3 for the database.

The project has has two types of users one is student and one is teacher, you can register/login as either one and will get functionality accordingly.

Students can enroll themselves in courses and later drop those courses, check their fees which gets updated according to the number of courses they have enrolled in, they can also send requests which the teachers can later respond to.


We have a Posts app which gives a blog like functionality where users can make posts, comment on the posts and like the posts, they can also edit/delete their posts and comments.

Then there's the products app where teachers can list products and students can order those products, there's search product to search a specific product, there's my cart to order multiple items at one time and there's also my orders page to keep track of all your current and previous orders.
